# KY Legislature Twitter Analysis

* I used `rtweet`, `tidyverse`, and `tidytext` to analyze the twitter usage of members of the Kentucky legislature.
    + I wrote about this project on my [blog](https://rkahne.github.io/blog/2017/08/31/kentucky-legislature-twitter-analysis/)
    + I also built a [shiny app](https://rkahne.shinyapps.io/kyleg_twitter/)
 
 * Many thanks to the Kentucky LRC for maintaining a list of current legislators on twitter!
 * Another big thank you to everyone who joined the Data For Democracy hackathon in the Spring of 2016 (they pulled much of the metadata about legislators)!
